## Introduction
### What is PyQt5 ? 
PyQt5 is a set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework. It allows developers to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other cross-platform applications using the Python programming language. In simple terms, it's a library that lets you use Python to build apps that have a graphical window, buttons, menus, and other visual elements.

### What is 50/30/20 budget rule ? 
The 50/30/20 budget rule is a simple, popular guideline for managing your personal finances. It suggests dividing your after-tax income into three main spending categories:

50% for Needs: These are your essential, non-negotiable expenses that you need to live. This includes things like rent or mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, transportation, and minimum debt payments.

30% for Wants: This category covers all your discretionary spendingâ€”the things you choose to buy that are not essential for survival. Examples include dining out, entertainment, subscriptions (like Netflix or Spotify), hobbies, and new clothes.

20% for Savings and Debt Repayment: This is the money you set aside for your financial future. It includes contributions to an emergency fund, retirement accounts (like a 401(k)), and paying down any debt beyond the minimum payments (like credit card or student loan debt).

The rule is meant to be a flexible framework, not a strict law. It helps you find a balance between covering your necessities, enjoying your life, and planning for the future.


## Set up && Run
I developed a finance management app using PyQt5 and MySQL that adheres to the 50/30/20 budgeting rule to help users prevent overspending.
To set up the app:
1. Run git
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/baokhanh546123/Managent-Money
```
2. Install the necessary libraries with
#### Windows

``` bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Linux / macOS

``` bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start the app using "loginUI1.py" or the packaged "loginUI.exe".
